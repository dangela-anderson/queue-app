# FlowQ: Front Desk Queue Management System

## Overview
At Henry Ford Health, I am a patient registration representative responsible for processing patients for walk-in ancillary services. In my department, we experience severe traffic surges that congest the waiting room and overwhelm the frontline staff. To mitigate our throughput bottleneck, I created a solution to optimize our operational workflow and improve patient experience and safety. I developed a virtual queue management system to reduce wait times, enhance team collaboration, track performance metrics, and protect sensitive PHI and PII.
